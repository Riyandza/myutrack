# 🎵 Myutrack

A minimalist clone of YouTube Music, built using Vue 3, Pinia, Vue Router, and Tailwind CSS.
This project focuses on recreating the core features of YouTube Music, including:

🎧 Homepage with trending and top chart songs
🔍 Search functionality for artists, albums, and tracks
📀 Artist/Album Detail Pages with song lists and previews
▶️ Global Music Player with persistent playback across pages

Powered by the Deezer API, this project allows users to explore songs, preview 30-second tracks, and enjoy a smooth SPA experience.
